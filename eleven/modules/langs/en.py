Ah, group management. It's all fun and games, until you start getting spammers in, and you need to ban them. Then you need to start banning more, and more, and it gets painful.
But then you have multiple groups, and you don't want these spammers in any of your groups - how can you deal? Do you have to ban them manually, in all your groups?

Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. {} has some enhancements, to make sure that \

- <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
- <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
- <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>, \
and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>
- <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram \
buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code> \
will be the url which is opened.
EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>
If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
<code>[one](buttonurl:example.com)
[two](buttonurl:google.com:same)</code>
This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.
